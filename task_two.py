"""
The task 2 goes like following:
1. Pull data for the movie ​A New Hope
2. Replace the data for each of the endpoints listed in the JSON object you receive from
the API request (e.g. - In the example above you would take all the character endpoints and pull the data from each of those endpoints then insert the data into the JSON object, etc.)
a. A New Hope​ has character, planet, starship, vehicle, and species data you will need to retrieve and replace.
3. We also ask that you convert the metric heights and weights of each character to standard units.
4. You will also need to remove all cross-referencing material from the data you replace (e.g. - When you pull Luke Skywalker you would want to remove cross-referencing URLs from Luke’s JSON object (like films, species, vehicles, and spaceships.)
5. Lastly, you will take the dictionary you created and write it out to a JSON file locally named ​task_two.json.​
